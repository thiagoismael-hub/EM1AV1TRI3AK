                <p>Life expectancy, the number of years people generally live, has changed considerably over time. For example, if you were a male child born in the UK a thousand years ago, in the Middle Ages, you might expect to live to be about 31 years old. In 1998, it would be 76, and today it is almost 80 for men, and over 83 for women. Medical advances, better nutrition, and the development of technology are all part of the reason for these changes.</p>
                <p>However, there are still some mysteries about life expectancy, such as why life expectancy is different for men and women. Girls born today will live, on average, nearly four years longer than boys, but we still can't be certain of the reason why this is so. Historically, scientists assumed that this was because men worked jobs that were more physical and dangerous. Another theory was that men were less likely to develop healthy habits, but neither of these theories is easy to prove. A far more probable explanation concerns evolution – and our hormones. The male hormone, testosterone, may cause men to “burn out” slightly faster than women. And women also benefit from the healing qualities of estrogen, the female hormone. Estrogen gets rid of poisonous chemicals in the body naturally.</p>
                <p>Life expectancy is also affected by geographical location. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco is the country with the world's highest life expectancy at 89.5 years. Singapore and Japan are in second place at 85 years. According to the CIA's rankings, the UK has the 35th highest life expectancy, ranking lower than countries like Iceland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Countries at the low end of the list tend to be those that have wars or are very poor. The African country of Chad has the lowest life expectancy in the world, at just over 50.</p>
